# Try, Except, else and Finally in Python

# try:
#        # Some Code.... 
# except:
#        # optional block
#        # Handling of exception (if required)
# else:
#        # execute if no exception
# finally:
#       # Some code .....(always executed)

  try:
    l = [1, 5, 6, 7]
    i = int(input("Enter the index: "))
    print(l[i])

    print("Some error occurred")
    return 0

def divide(x, y): 
    try: 
        # Floor Division : Gives only Fractional
        # Part as Answer 
        result = x // y 
        print("Yeah ! Your answer is :", result)

# Catch Multiple Exceptions in Python
# Hereâ€™s an example that demonstrates how to use multiple except clauses to handle different exceptions:

try:
    x = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    result = 10 / x
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("You cannot divide by zero.")
except ValueError:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a valid number.")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
