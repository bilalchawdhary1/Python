#     Enumerate() in Python
# Last Updated : 25 Jul, 2024
# Often, when dealing with iterators, we also need to keep a count of iterations. Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in function enumerate() for this task. The enumerate () function adds a counter to an iterable and returns it in the form of an enumerating object. This enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted into a list of tuples using the list() function.

#  Syntax:  enumerate(iterable, start=0) 


#  Parameters: 


#  Iterable:  any object that supports iteration 
#  Start:  the index value from which the counter is to be started, by default it is 0 
#  Return:  Returns an iterator with index and element pairs from the original iterable 


# Example

# Here, we are using the enumerate() function with both a list and a string. Creating enumerate objects for each and displaying their return types. It also shows how to change the starting index for enumeration when applied to a string, resulting in index-element pairs for the list and string .
