# Set in Python 
# Set
# Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
# Set is one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections 
# of data, the other 3 are List, Tuple, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
# A set is a collection which is 👉 unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed.
# * Note: Set items are unchangeable, but you can remove items and add new items.

s = {2,4,2,"set", False}
print(s)
# thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
# print(thisset)
# Duplicate values will be ignored:
thisset = {"apple", "banana", "cherry", "apple"}
print(thisset)

# Python Set Methods

# Python has a set of built-in methods that you can use on sets.

# Method	Shortcut	Description
# add()	 	Adds an element to the set
# clear()	 	Removes all the elements from the set
# copy()	 	Returns a copy of the set
# difference()	-	Returns a set containing the difference between two or more sets
# difference_update()	-=	Removes the items in this set that are also included in another, specified set
# discard()	 	Remove the specified item
# intersection()	&	Returns a set, that is the intersection of two other sets
# intersection_update()	&=	Removes the items in this set that are not present in other, specified set(s)
# isdisjoint()	 	Returns whether two sets have a intersection or not
# issubset()	<=	Returns whether another set contains this set or not
#  	<	Returns whether all items in this set is present in other, specified set(s)
# issuperset()	>=	Returns whether this set contains another set or not
#  	>	Returns whether all items in other, specified set(s) is present in this set
# pop()	 	Removes an element from the set
# remove()	 	Removes the specified element
# symmetric_difference()	^	Returns a set with the symmetric differences of two sets
# symmetric_difference_update()	^=	Inserts the symmetric differences from this set and another
# union()	|	Return a set containing the union of sets
# update()	|=	Update the set with the union of this set and others
